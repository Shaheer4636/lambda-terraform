Quick heads-up: this isn’t just a Lambda job. It’s a full pipeline—EventBridge triggers, Synthetics canaries across 10+ apps per client, our report Lambda, S3 outputs, optional QuickSight PDFs, plus alarms and IAM. We’re pulling minute-level metrics, paginating and merging them, then computing FAIL_STREAK availability, incident windows, MTTR/MTBF, percentiles, and daily rollups. The system publishes multiple synchronized artifacts—JSONL, per-client CSVs, a yearly rollup, and multi-page A4 HTML, with an option to export PDF—so formatting and consistency matter.

Our biggest dependency is stable endpoints and auth. Several URLs only arrived this week and a few still fail, so we can’t finalize SLA math or charts until those are fixed. The good news: about eighty percent is done—data ingestion, calculations, charts, incidents, daily tables, S3 structure, Terraform modules, and alarms are in place. What’s left is endpoint stabilization, a quick sign-off on FAIL_STREAK/SLA, wiring the PDF export, and UAT. Once those pieces land, this becomes a dependable, auditable monthly reporting platform, not just a scheduled function.

That aligns with the next-month task plan (endpoint fixes, PDF wiring, FAIL_STREAK/SLA sign-off, and UAT).
If you want milestones to say out loud: Code freeze 28 Oct → UAT sign-off 30 Oct → GA 31 Oct.
